/// provides the basis for archiving (where objects and other structures are
/// stored on disk) and distribution (where objects are copied to different
/// address spaces).
///
/// In keeping with object-oriented design principles, an object being encoded
/// or decoded is responsible for encoding and decoding its instance variables.
/// A coder instructs the object to do so by invoking `encode(with:)` or
/// `init(coder:)`. `encode(with:)` instructs the object to encode its instance
/// variables to the coder provided; this method can be invoked any number of
/// times. `init(coder:)` instructs the object to initialize itself from data
/// in the coder provided.
/// Any object class that should be codable must adopt the NSCoding protocol and
/// implement its methods.

/// Conforming to the `NSSecureCoding` protocol indicates that an object handles
/// encoding and decoding instances of itself in a manner that is robust against
/// object substitution attacks.
///
/// Historically, many classes decoded instances of themselves like this:
/// ```swift
/// if let object = decoder.decodeObject(forKey: "myKey") as? MyClass {
///     ...succeeds...
/// } else {
///     ...fail...
/// }
/// ```
/// This technique is potentially unsafe because by the time you can verify
/// the class type, the object has already been constructed, and if this is part
/// of a collection class, potentially inserted into an object graph.
///
/// In order to conform to `NSSecureCoding`:
/// - An object that does not override `init(coder:)` can conform to
///   `NSSecureCoding` without any changes (assuming that it is a subclass
///   of another class that conforms).
/// - An object that does override `init(coder:)` must decode any enclosed
///   objects using the `decodeObject(of:forKey:)` method. For example:
///   ```swift
///   let obj = decoder.decodeObject(of: MyClass.self, forKey: "myKey")
///   ```
///   In addition, the class must override its `NSSecureCoding` method to return
///   `true`.

/// The `NSCoder` abstract class declares the interface used by concrete
/// subclasses to transfer objects and other values between memory and some
/// other format. This capability provides the basis for archiving (where
/// objects and data items are stored on disk) and distribution (where objects
/// and data items are copied between different processes or threads). The
/// concrete subclasses provided by Foundation for these purposes are
/// `NSKeyedArchiver` and `NSKeyedUnarchiver`. Concrete subclasses of `NSCoder`
/// are referred to in general as coder classes, and instances of these classes
/// as coder objects (or simply coders). A coder object that can only encode
/// values is referred to as an encoder object, and one that can only decode
/// values as a decoder object.
///
/// `NSCoder` operates on objects, scalars, C arrays, structures, and strings,
/// and on pointers to these types. It does not handle types whose
/// implementation varies across platforms, such as `UnsafeRawPointer`,
/// closures, and long chains of pointers. A coder object stores object type
/// information along with the data, so an object decoded from a stream of bytes
/// is normally of the same class as the object that was originally encoded into
/// the stream. An object can change its class when encoded, however; this is
/// described in Archives and Serializations Programming Guide.
