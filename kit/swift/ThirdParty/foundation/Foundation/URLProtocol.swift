    @header URLProtocol.h

    This header file describes the constructs used to represent URL
    protocols, and describes the extensible system by which specific
    classes can be made to handle the loading of particular URL types or
    schemes.
    
    <p>URLProtocol is an abstract class which provides the
    basic structure for performing protocol-specific loading of URL
    data.
    
    <p>The URLProtocolClient describes the integration points a
    protocol implemention can use to hook into the URL loading system.
    URLProtocolClient describes the methods a protocol implementation
    needs to drive the URL loading system from a URLProtocol subclass.
    
    <p>To support customization of protocol-specific requests,
    protocol implementors are encouraged to provide categories on
    NSURLRequest and NSMutableURLRequest. Protocol implementors who
    need to extend the capabilities of NSURLRequest and
    NSMutableURLRequest in this way can store and retrieve
    protocol-specific request data by using the
    <tt>+propertyForKey:inRequest:</tt> and
    <tt>+setProperty:forKey:inRequest:</tt> class methods on
    URLProtocol. See the NSHTTPURLRequest on NSURLRequest and
    NSMutableHTTPURLRequest on NSMutableURLRequest for examples of
    such extensions.
    
    <p>An essential responsibility for a protocol implementor is
    creating a URLResponse for each request it processes successfully.
    A protocol implementor may wish to create a custom, mutable 
    URLResponse class to aid in this work.
