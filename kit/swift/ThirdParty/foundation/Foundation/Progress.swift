 `Progress` is used to report the amount of work done, and provides a way to allow the user to cancel that work.
 
 Since work is often split up into several parts, progress objects can form a tree where children represent part of the overall total work. Each parent may have as many children as required, but each child only has one parent. The top level progress object in this tree is typically the one that you would display to a user. The leaf objects are updated as work completes, and the updates propagate up the tree.
 
 The work that a `Progress` does is tracked via a "unit count." There are two unit count values: total and completed. In its leaf form, a `Progress` is created with a total unit count and its completed unit count is updated by setting `completedUnitCount` until it matches the `totalUnitCount`. The progress is then considered finished.
 
 When progress objects form nodes in trees, they are still created with a total unit count. Portions of the total are then handed out to children as a "pending unit count." The total amount handed out to children should add up to the parent's `totalUnitCount`. When those children become finished, the pending unit count assigned to that child is added to the parent's `completedUnitCount`. Therefore, when all children are finished, the parent's `completedUnitCount` is equal to its `totalUnitCount` and it becomes finished itself.
 
 Children `Progress` objects can be added implicitly or by calling `addChild(withPendingUnitCount)` on the parent. Implicitly added children are attached to a parent progress between a call to `becomeCurrent(withPendingUnitCount)` and a call to `resignCurrent`. The implicit child is created with the `Progress(totalUnitCount:)` initializer, or by passing the result of `Progress.currentProgress` to the `Progress(parent:userInfo:)` initializer. Both kinds of children can be attached to the same parent progress object. If you have an idea in advance that some portions of the work will take more or less time than the others, you can use different values of pending unit count for each child.
 
 If you are designing an interface of an object that reports progress, then the recommended approach is to vend a `Progress` property and adopt the `ProgressReporting` protocol. The progress should be created with the `Progress.discreteProgress(withTotalUnitCount:)` class function. You can then either update the progress object directly or set it up to have children of its own. Users of your object can compose your progress into their tree by using the `addChild(withPendingUnitCount)` function.
 
 If you want to provide progress reporting for a single method, then the recommended approach is to implicitly attach to a current `Progress` by creating an `Progress` object at the very beginning of your method using `Progress(withTotalUnitCount)`. This progress object will consume the pending unit count, and then you can set up the progress object with children of its own.

 The `localizedDescription` and `localizedAdditionalDescription` properties are meant to be observed as well as set. So are the `cancellable` and `pausable` properties. `totalUnitCount` and `completedUnitCount`, on the other hand, are often not the best properties to observe when presenting progress to the user. You should observe `fractionCompleted` instead of observing `totalUnitCount` and `completedUnitCount` and doing your own calculation. `Progress`' default implementation of `fractionCompleted` does fairly sophisticated things like taking child `Progress` into account.
