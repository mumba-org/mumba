# Archiving Notes

There is a preliminary implementation of NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver which should be compatible with the macOS version.

* NSKeyedUnarchiver reads the entire plist into memory before constructing the object graph, it should construct it incrementally as does Foundation on macOS

* Paths that raise errors vs. calling _fatalError() need to be reviewed carefully

* The signature of the decoding APIs that take a class whitelist has changed from NSSet to [AnyClass] as AnyClass does not support Hashable. The API change has been marked Experimental.

* classForKeyed[Un]Archiver has moved into NSObject so it can be overridden, move this back into an extension eventually

# Classes
