# Implementation Status

This document lays out the structure of the Foundation project, and provides the current implementation status of each major feature.

Foundation is divided into groups of related functionality. These groups are currently laid out in the Xcode project, even though they are in a flat structure on disk.

As Foundation is a work in progress, not all methods and functionality are present. When implementations are completed, this list should be updated to reflect the current state of the library.

#### Table Key

##### Implementation Status
* _N/A_: This entity is internal or private and implemented ad hoc; there are no guidelines in place to suggest what completion might look like
* _Unimplemented_: This entity exists, but all functions and methods are `NSUnimplemented()`
* _Incomplete_: Implementation of this entity has begun, but critical sections have been left `NSUnimplemented()`
* _Mostly Complete_: All critical sections of this entity have been implemented, but some methods might remain `NSUnimplemented()`
* _Complete_: No methods are left `NSUnimplemented()` (though this is not a guarantee that work is complete -- there may be methods that need overriding or extra work)

##### Test Coverage
* _N/A_: This entity is internal and public tests are inappropriate, or it is an entity for which testing does not make sense
* _None_: There are no unit tests specific to this entity; even if it is used indirectly in other unit tests, we should have tests targeting this entity in isolation
* _Incomplete_: Unit tests exist for this entity, but there are critical paths that are not being tested
* _Substantial_: Most, if not all, of this entity's critical paths are being tested

There is no _Complete_ status for test coverage because there are always additional tests to be implemented. Even entities with _Substantial_ coverage are missing tests (e.g. `NSCoding` conformance, `NSCopying` conformance, `description`s, etc.)

### Entities

* **Runtime**: The basis for interoperability.

    The classes and methods in this group provide an interface for interoperability between C code and Swift. They also provide common layers used throughout the framework such as the root class `NSObject`.

* **URL**: Networking primitives

    The classes in this group provide functionality for manipulating URLs and paths via a common model object. The group also has classes for creating and receiving network connections.

* **Formatters**: Locale and language-correct formatted values.

    This group contains the is the base `NSFormatter` class and its subclasses. These formatters can be used for dates, numbers, sizes, energy, and many other types.

* **XML**: A group of classes for parsing and representing XML documents and elements.

    The classes provided in this group are responsible for parsing and validating XML. They should be an interface for representing libxml2 in a more object-oriented manner.

* **Collections**: A group of classes to contain objects.

    The classes provided in this group provide basic collections. The primary role for these classes is to provide an interface layer between the CoreFoundation implementations and the standard library implementations. Additionally, they have useful extras like serialization support. There are also additional collection types that the standard library does not support.

     > _Note_: See [Known Issues](Issues.md) for more information about bridging between Foundation collection types and Swift standard library collection types.

* **String**: A set of classes for scanning, manipulating and storing string values.

    The NSString implementation is present to provide an interface layer between CoreFoundation and Swift, but it also adds additional functionality on top of the Swift standard library String type. Other classes in this group provide mechanisms to scan, match regular expressions, store attributes in run arrays attached to strings, and represent sets of characters.

    > _Note_: See [Known Issues](Issues.md) for more information about bridging between the Foundation NSString types and Swift standard library String type.
