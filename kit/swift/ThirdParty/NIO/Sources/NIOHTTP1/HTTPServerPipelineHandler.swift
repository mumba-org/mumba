/// A `ChannelHandler` that handles HTTP pipelining by buffering inbound data until a
/// response has been sent.
///
/// This handler ensures that HTTP server pipelines only process one request at a time.
/// This is the safest way for pipelining-unaware code to operate, as it ensures that
/// mutation of any shared server state is not parallelised, and that responses are always
/// sent for each request in turn. In almost all cases this is the behaviour that a
/// pipeline will want. This is achieved without doing too much buffering by preventing
/// the `Channel` from reading from the socket until a complete response is processed,
/// ensuring that a malicious client is not capable of overwhelming a server by shoving
/// an enormous amount of data down the `Channel` while a server is processing a
/// slow response.
///
/// See [RFC 7320 Section 6.3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.3.2) for
/// more details on safely handling HTTP pipelining.
///
/// In addition to handling the request buffering, this `ChannelHandler` is aware of
/// TCP half-close. While there are very few HTTP clients that are capable of TCP
/// half-close, clients that are not HTTP specific (e.g. `netcat`) may trigger a TCP
/// half-close. Having this `ChannelHandler` be aware of TCP half-close makes it easier
/// to build HTTP servers that are resilient to this kind of behaviour.
///
/// The TCP half-close handling is done by buffering the half-close notification along
/// with the HTTP request parts. The half-close notification will be delivered in order
/// with the rest of the reads. If the half-close occurs either before a request is received
/// or during a request body upload, it will be delivered immediately. If a half-close is
/// received immediately after `HTTPServerRequestPart.end`, it will also be passed along
/// immediately, allowing this signal to be seen by the HTTP server as early as possible.
