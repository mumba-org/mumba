# Approximate Aggregate Functions

Approximate aggregate functions are scalable in terms of memory usage and time,
but produce approximate results instead of exact results. For more background,
see [Approximate Aggregation][link-to-approximate-aggregation].

### APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT

```
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(expression [HAVING (MAX | MIN) expression2])
```

**Description**

Returns the approximate result for `COUNT(DISTINCT expression)`. The value
returned is a statistical estimate&mdash;not necessarily the actual value.

This function is less accurate than `COUNT(DISTINCT expression)`, but performs
better on huge input.

**Supported Argument Types**

Any data type **except**:
`ARRAY`
`STRUCT`
`PROTO`

**Optional Clause**

`HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates to those having a value for `expression2` equal to the
    maximum or minimum value for `expression2`. The minimum or maximum value is
    equal to the result of `MAX(expression2)` or `MIN(expression2)`. This clause
    ignores `NULL` values when computing the maximum or minimum value unless
    `expression2` evaluates to `NULL` for all rows. This clause
    does not support the following data types:
    `ARRAY`
    `STRUCT`
    `PROTO`

**Returned Data Types**

INT64

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(x) as approx_distinct
FROM UNNEST([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]) as x;

+-----------------+
| approx_distinct |
+-----------------+
| 5               |
+-----------------+
```

### APPROX_QUANTILES

```
APPROX_QUANTILES([DISTINCT] expression, number [{IGNORE|RESPECT} NULLS] [HAVING (MAX | MIN) expression2])
```

**Description**

Returns the approximate boundaries for a group of `expression` values, where
`number` represents the number of quantiles to create. This function returns
an array of `number` + 1 elements, where the first element is the approximate
minimum and the last element is the approximate maximum.

**Supported Argument Types**

`expression` can be any supported data type **except**:
`ARRAY`
`STRUCT`
`PROTO`

`number` must be INT64.

**Optional Clauses**

The clauses are applied *in the following order*:

1.  `DISTINCT`: Each distinct value of
    `expression` is aggregated only once into the result.
1.  `IGNORE NULLS` or `RESPECT NULLS`: If `IGNORE NULLS` is
    specified or if neither is specified,
    the NULL values are excluded from the result. If `RESPECT NULLS` is
    specified,
    the NULL values are included in the result.
1.  `HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates to those having a value for `expression2` equal to the
    maximum or minimum value for `expression2`. The minimum or maximum value is
    equal to the result of `MAX(expression2)` or `MIN(expression2)`. This clause
    ignores `NULL` values when computing the maximum or minimum value unless
    `expression2` evaluates to `NULL` for all rows. This clause
    does not support the following data types:
    `ARRAY`
    `STRUCT`
    `PROTO`

**Returned Data Types**

An ARRAY of the type specified by the `expression`
parameter.

Returns `NULL` if there are zero input
rows or `expression` evaluates to NULL for all rows.

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES(x, 2) AS approx_quantiles
FROM UNNEST([NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) AS x;

+------------------+
| approx_quantiles |
+------------------+
| [1, 5, 10]       |
+------------------+

SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES(x, 100)[OFFSET(90)] AS percentile_90
FROM UNNEST([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) AS x;

+---------------+
| percentile_90 |
+---------------+
| 9             |
+---------------+

SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES(DISTINCT x, 2) AS approx_quantiles
FROM UNNEST([NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) AS x;

+------------------+
| approx_quantiles |
+------------------+
| [1, 6, 10]       |
+------------------+

SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES(x, 2 RESPECT NULLS) AS approx_quantiles
FROM UNNEST([NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) AS x;

+------------------+
| approx_quantiles |
+------------------+
| [NULL, 4, 10]    |
+------------------+

SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES(DISTINCT x, 2 RESPECT NULLS) AS approx_quantiles
FROM UNNEST([NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) AS x;

+------------------+
| approx_quantiles |
+------------------+
| [NULL, 6, 10]    |
+------------------+

```

### APPROX_TOP_COUNT

```
APPROX_TOP_COUNT(expression, number [HAVING (MAX | MIN) expression2])
```

**Description**

Returns the approximate top elements of `expression`. The `number` parameter
specifies the number of elements returned.

**Supported Argument Types**

`expression` can be of any data type that the `GROUP BY` clause supports.

`number` must be INT64.

**Optional Clause**

`HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates to those having a value for `expression2` equal to the
    maximum or minimum value for `expression2`. The minimum or maximum value is
    equal to the result of `MAX(expression2)` or `MIN(expression2)`. This clause
    ignores `NULL` values when computing the maximum or minimum value unless
    `expression2` evaluates to `NULL` for all rows. This clause
    does not support the following data types:
    `ARRAY`
    `STRUCT`
    `PROTO`

**Returned Data Types**

An ARRAY of type STRUCT.
The STRUCT contains two fields. The first field
(named `value`) contains an input value. The second field (named `count`)
contains an INT64 specifying the number of times the
value was returned.

Returns `NULL` if there are zero input rows.

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT APPROX_TOP_COUNT(x, 2) as approx_top_count
FROM UNNEST(["apple", "apple", "pear", "pear", "pear", "banana"]) as x;

+-------------------------+
| approx_top_count        |
+-------------------------+
| [{pear, 3}, {apple, 2}] |
+-------------------------+
```

**NULL handling**

APPROX_TOP_COUNT does not ignore NULLs in the input. For example:

```sql
SELECT APPROX_TOP_COUNT(x, 2) as approx_top_count
FROM UNNEST([NULL, "pear", "pear", "pear", "apple", NULL]) as x;

+------------------------+
| approx_top_count       |
+------------------------+
| [{pear, 3}, {NULL, 2}] |
+------------------------+
```

### APPROX_TOP_SUM

```
APPROX_TOP_SUM(expression, weight, number [HAVING (MAX | MIN) expression2])
```

**Description**

Returns the approximate top elements of `expression`, based on the sum of an
assigned `weight`. The `number` parameter specifies the number of elements
returned.

If the `weight` input is negative or `NaN`, this function returns an error.

**Supported Argument Types**

`expression` can be of any data type that the `GROUP BY` clause supports.

`weight` must be one of the following:

<ul>
<li>INT64</li>

<li>UINT64</li>

<li>DOUBLE</li>
</ul>

`number` must be INT64.

**Optional Clause**

`HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates to those having a value for `expression2` equal to the
    maximum or minimum value for `expression2`. The minimum or maximum value is
    equal to the result of `MAX(expression2)` or `MIN(expression2)`. This clause
    ignores `NULL` values when computing the maximum or minimum value unless
    `expression2` evaluates to `NULL` for all rows. This clause
    does not support the following data types:
    `ARRAY`
    `STRUCT`
    `PROTO`

**Returned Data Types**

An ARRAY of type STRUCT.
The STRUCT contains two fields: `value` and `sum`.
The `value` field contains the value of the input expression. The `sum` field is
the same type as`weight`, and is the approximate sum of the input weight
associated with the `value` field.

Returns `NULL` if there are zero input rows.

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT APPROX_TOP_SUM(x, weight, 2) AS approx_top_sum FROM
UNNEST([
  STRUCT("apple" AS x, 3 AS weight),
  ("pear", 2),
  ("apple", 0),
  ("banana", 5),
  ("pear", 4)
]);

+--------------------------+
| approx_top_sum           |
+--------------------------+
| [{pear, 6}, {banana, 5}] |
+--------------------------+
```

**NULL handling**

APPROX_TOP_SUM does not ignore NULL values for the `expression` and `weight`
parameters.

```sql
SELECT APPROX_TOP_SUM(x, weight, 2) AS approx_top_sum FROM
UNNEST([STRUCT("apple" AS x, NULL AS weight), ("pear", 0), ("pear", NULL)]);

+----------------------------+
| approx_top_sum             |
+----------------------------+
| [{pear, 0}, {apple, NULL}] |
+----------------------------+
```

```sql
SELECT APPROX_TOP_SUM(x, weight, 2) AS approx_top_sum FROM
UNNEST([STRUCT("apple" AS x, 0 AS weight), (NULL, 2)]);

+-------------------------+
| approx_top_sum          |
+-------------------------+
| [{NULL, 2}, {apple, 0}] |
+-------------------------+
```

```sql
SELECT APPROX_TOP_SUM(x, weight, 2) AS approx_top_sum FROM
UNNEST([STRUCT("apple" AS x, 0 AS weight), (NULL, NULL)]);

+----------------------------+
| approx_top_sum             |
+----------------------------+
| [{apple, 0}, {NULL, NULL}] |
+----------------------------+
```
