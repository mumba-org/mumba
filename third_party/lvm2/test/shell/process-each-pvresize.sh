# process_each_pv is used by a number of pv commands:
# pvdisplay
# pvresize
# pvs
# vgreduce

#
# set up
#
# use use dev10 instead of dev1 because simple grep for
# dev1 matchines dev10,dev11,etc

# For pvs in vgs, pvresize setphysicalvolumesize does not give us
# the size requested, but reduces the requested size by some the
# amount for alignment, metadata areas and pv headers.  So, when we resize
# to 30M, the result is 28M, and when we resize to 20M, the result is 16M.
# For orphans, the resulting size is the same as requested.
# It suspect that these reduction amounts might be inconsistent, and
# depend on other changing factors, so it may be that we eventually
# want to give up checking the exact resulting size, but just check
# that the result is less than the original size.
