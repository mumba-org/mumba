This directory contains nix integration for building and testing LVM2 in various
virtual machine configurations. The *.nix files are written in the nix
declarative language (see http://nixos.org/nix).

There are two basic use-cases for this integration. First, a hydra instance (see
http://divine.fi.muni.cz/hydra/project/lvm2 and
http://divine.fi.muni.cz/~xrockai/lvm-testmatrix.html) builds and tests LVM in
all the configurations described in default.nix after every push to the git
repository. Second, any nix-enabled system can very closely reproduce any of
those test scenarios using the "build.sh" script and an appropriate checkout of
"nixpkgs" (cf. http://nixos.org/nixpkgs).

(The rest of this document is TODO.)
