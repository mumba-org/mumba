 * After leaving the critical section, memory stays locked until 
 * memlock_unlock() is called.  This happens with
 * sync_local_dev_names() and sync_dev_names().
 *
 * This allows critical sections to be entered and exited repeatedly without
 * incurring the expense of locking memory every time.
 *
 * memlock_reset() is necessary to clear the state after forking (polldaemon).
