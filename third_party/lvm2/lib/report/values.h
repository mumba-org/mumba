/*
 * This file defines reserved names for field values.
 *
 * This is used for registering reserved names with reporting code that
 * uses the exact value defined whenever the reserved name is hit, for
 * example during selection criteria processing.
 *
 * TYPE_RESERVED_VALUE defines reserved value that is not bound to any field,
 * but rather it's bound to a certain type. This can be used as a reserved
 * value for all fields of that type then. When naming type reserved value,
 * please follow this naming scheme:
 *   <report type name in lowercase>_<reserved_value_name>
 *
 * FIELD_RESERVED_VALUE defines reserved value bound to a single field.
 * When naming reserved value for the field, please follow this naming scheme:
 *   <field_name>_<reserved_value_name>
 *
 * FIELD_BINARY_RESERVED_VALUE is similar to FIELD_RESERVED_VALUE but it
 * is specifically designed for defintion of reserved names for fields
 * with binary values where the reserved names given denote value 1.
 * The first reserved_name given is also used for reporting,
 * others are synonyms which are recognized in addition.
