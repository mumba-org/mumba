.SH USAGE

.SS info

This collects and displays lock state from lvmlockd.  The display is
primitive, incomplete and will change in future version.  To print the raw
lock state from lvmlockd, combine this option with --dump|-d.

.SS dump

This collects the circular log buffer of debug statements from lvmlockd
and prints it.

.SS kill

This is run by sanlock when it loses access to the storage holding leases
for a VG.  It currently emits a syslog message stating that the VG must
be immediately deactivated.  In the future it may automatically attempt to
forcibly deactivate the VG.  For more, see
.BR lvmlockd (8).

.SS drop

This should only be run after a VG has been successfully deactivated
following an lvmlockctl \-\-kill command.  It clears the stale lockspace
from lvmlockd.  In the future, this may become automatic along with an
automatic handling of \-\-kill.  For more, see
.BR lvmlockd (8).

.SS gl\-enable

This enables the global lock in a sanlock VG.  This is necessary if the VG
that previously held the global lock is removed.  For more, see
.BR lvmlockd (8).

.SS gl\-disable

This disables the global lock in a sanlock VG.  This is necessary if the
global lock has mistakenly been enabled in more than one VG.  The global
lock should be disabled in all but one sanlock VG.  For more, see
.BR lvmlockd (8).

.SS stop\-lockspaces

This tells lvmlockd to stop all lockspaces.  It can be useful to stop
lockspaces for VGs that the vgchange \-\-lock\-stop comand can no longer
see, or to stop the dlm global lockspace which is not directly stopped by
the vgchange command.  The wait and force options can be used with this
command.
