lvm2-activation-generator \- generator for systemd units to activate LVM2 volumes on boot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #SYSTEMD_GENERATOR_DIR#/lvm2-activation-generator
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
The lvm2-activation-generator is called by \fBsystemd\fP(1) on boot
to generate systemd units at runtime to activate LVM2 volumes if
\fBlvmetad\fP(8) is disabled (global/use_lvmetad=0 \fBlvm.conf\fP(5)
option is used). Otherwise, if \fBlvmetad\fP(8) is enabled,
the lvm2-activation-generator exits immediately without generating
any systemd units and LVM2 fully relies on event-based activation
to activate the LVM2 volumes instead using the \fBpvscan\fP(8)
(pvscan \-\-cache -aay) call that is a part of \fBudev\fP(8) rules.

These systemd units are generated by lvm2-activation-generator:
.sp
\fIlvm2-activation-early.service\fP
used for activation of LVM2 volumes that is ordered before systemd's
special \fBcryptsetup.target\fP to support LVM2 volumes which are not
layered on top of encrypted devices.

\fIlvm2-activation.service\fP
used for activation of LVM2 volumes that is ordered after systemd's
special \fBcryptsetup.target\fP to support LVM2 volumes which are
layered on top of encrypted devices.

\fIlvm2-activation-net.service\fP
used for activation of LVM2 volumes that is ordered after systemd's
special \fBremote-fs.target\fP to support LVM2 volumes which are layered
on attached remote devices.

Note that all the underlying devices (Physical Volumes) need to be present
when the service is run. If the there are any devices presented in the system
anytime later, any LVM2 volumes on top of such devices need to be activated
directly by \fBlvchange\fP(8) or \fBvgchange\fP(8). This limitation does
not exist when using \fBlvmetad\fP(8) and accompanying event-based activation
since such LVM volumes are activated automatically as soon as the Volume Group
is ready (all the Physical Volumes making up the Volume Group are present
in the system).

The lvm2-activation-generator implements the \fBGenerators Specification\fP
as referenced in \fBsystemd\fP(1).
