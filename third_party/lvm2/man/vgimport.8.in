.SH DESCRIPTION
vgimport allows you to make a Volume Group that was previously
exported using
.BR vgexport (8)
known to the system again, perhaps after moving its Physical Volumes
from a different machine.
vgexport clears the VG system ID, and vgimport sets the VG system ID
to match the host running vgimport (if the host has a system ID).
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP(8) for common options.

Import all exported Volume Groups.

failed and they cannot be restored.
