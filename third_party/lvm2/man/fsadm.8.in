It tries to use the same API for 
.IR ext2 ", " ext3 ", " ext4 ", " ReiserFS " and " XFS
filesystem.

.TP
.I new_size
Absolute number of filesystem blocks to be in the filesystem,
or an absolute size using a suffix (in powers of 1024).
If new_size is not supplied, the whole device is used.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On successful completion, the status code is 0.
A status code of 2 indicates the operation was interrupted by the user.
A status code of 3 indicates the requested check operation could not be performed
because the filesystem is mounted and does not support an online 
.BR fsck (8).
A status code of 1 is used for other failures.

.SH EXAMPLES
Resize the filesystem on logical volume /dev/vg/test to 1000 megabytes.
If /dev/vg/test contains ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem it will be unmounted prior the resize.
All [y/n] questions will be answered 'y'.
