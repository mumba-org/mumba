.SH REPLACING PHYSICAL VOLUMES
\fBvgdisplay \-\-partial \-\-verbose\fP will show you the UUIDs and sizes of
any PVs that are no longer present.
If a PV in the VG is lost and you wish to substitute 
another of the same size, use 
\fBpvcreate \-\-restorefile filename \-\-uuid uuid\fP (plus additional 
arguments as appropriate) to initialise it with the same UUID as 
the missing PV.  Repeat for all other missing PVs in the VG. 
Then use \fBvgcfgrestore \-\-file filename\fP to restore the volume
group's metadata.
