.SH DESCRIPTION
blkdeactivate utility deactivates block devices. If a device
is mounted, the utility can unmount it automatically before
trying to deactivate. The utility currently supports
device-mapper devices, including LVM volumes.
LVM volumes are handled directly using the \fBlvm\fP(8) command.
Other device-mapper based devices are handled using the
\fBdmsetup\fP(8) command.
