// Monitors the reachability to the gateway and DNS servers on a given interface
// based on the information from the neighbor table in Linux kernel.
//
// This class interacts with the neighbor table via rtnetlink messages. The NUD
// (Neighbour Unreachability Detection) state in the neighbor table shows the
// bidirectional reachability between this interface and the given address. When
// OnIPConfigChanged() is called, a watching list is created with all valid
// addresses ({gateway, local dns servers} x {ipv4, ipv6}) in this ipconfig. For
// each address in the watching list, this class will:
// - Listen to the NUD state changed event from kernel;
// - When applicable, periodically set NUD state into NUD_PROBE to make the
//   kernel send probe packets.
//
// Normally, the following events will happen after an address is added:
// 1) We (this class) send a RTM_GETNEIGH request with NLM_F_DUMP flag to the
//    kernel to get the current state of this address (maybe with other
//    addresses together, since this is a dump request) (note that we cannot
//    send a real get request to retrieve a single entry, it's not supported by
//    Linux kernel v4.x and earlier versions);
// 2) On receiving the response from the kernel, we send a RTM_NEWNEIGH request
//    at once to set the NUD state of this address into NUD_PROBE, when
//    applicable;
// 3) The kernel sends out an ARP request (IPv4) or NS (IPv6) packet to this
//    address, and we are notified that the NUD state in the kernel table is
//    changed to NUD_PROBE.
// 4) The kernel receives the response packet and changes the state into
//    NUD_REACHABLE and notifies us.
// 5) Do nothing until the timer is triggered, and then jump to Step 2.
//
// In the case of "failure":
// - If we fail to get the information in Step 1, when the timer is triggered,
//   we will try to send the RTM_GETNEIGH request again (jump to Step 1).
// - If the kernel fails to detect the reachability in Step 3 (i.e., several
//   timeouts happen), we will be notified that the state is changed to
//   NUD_FAILED. Then we will do nothing for this address, until we heard about
//   it again from kernel.
//
// We will broadcast a signal when the bidirectional reachability of a monitored
// neighbor changes, based on its NUD state, as follows:
// - Only NUD_FAILED and NUD_REACHABLE is considered for generating this signal.
//   We refer to these two states as "effective states".
// - If the NUD state becomes NUD_FAILED, that is a clear signal that the
//   reachability has been lost. We will consider the neighbor is "in failure"
//   now and broadcast the "FAILED" signal if its previous effective state was
//   not NUD_FAILED. (It's possible that the NUD state becomes NUD_FAILED for
//   several times before it comes to NUD_REACHABLE, because (something makes)
//   the kernel probing that entry. We only generate one signal for that case.)
// - If the NUD state becomes NUD_REACHABLE when the previous effetive state was
//   not NUD_REACHABLE, that is a clear signal that the reachability has been
//   confirmed, and we will broadcast a "REACHABLE" signal.
// - When a neighbor is just added, we treat its effective state as UNKNOWN, and
//   will broadcast either "FAILED" or "REACHABLE" once we get its effective
//   state.
