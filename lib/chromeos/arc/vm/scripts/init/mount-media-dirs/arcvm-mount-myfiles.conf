# Do not allow OOM killer to terminate this job since it will break file
# sharing support (which e.g. our Photos app relies on) until ARCVM restarts.
# TODO(b/164939771): Choose a better OOM score which guarantees the Chrome
# browser process is always terminated before this one.
oom score never

# VmHWM of the process is ~6 MB in the steady state, and setting the VM size
# soft limit below that results in process termination. On the other hand,
# VmPeak points to somewhat higher value (~200 MB), and if we specify a soft
# limit lower than that, while not causing process termination, it results in
# memory allocation errors for actions like `ls` command.
# Given that, we choose to set a high value of 1 GB as the soft limit here.
# TODO(b/164936284): Specify a lower limit after improving mount-passthrough.
