  # Create the runtime directory for Android's "Play files" accessed by
  # seneschal and the Files app. Make it a shared mount point so that mount
  # events inside mount-passthrough's namespace are propagated to the init
  # namespace. We do this here because the directory needs to be mounted
  # before seneschal starts.
  # UID and GID of the directory are set to android-root:android-everybody.
