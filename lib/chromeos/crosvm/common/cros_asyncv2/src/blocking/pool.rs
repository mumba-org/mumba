/// A thread pool for running work that may block.
///
/// It is generally discouraged to do any blocking work inside an async function. However, this is
/// sometimes unavoidable when dealing with interfaces that don't provide async variants. In this
/// case callers may use the `BlockingPool` to run the blocking work on a different thread and
/// `await` for its result to finish, which will prevent blocking the main thread of the
/// application.
///
/// Since the blocking work is sent to another thread, users should be careful when using the
/// `BlockingPool` for latency-sensitive operations. Additionally, the `BlockingPool` is intended to
/// be used for work that will eventually complete on its own. Users who want to spawn a thread
/// should just use `thread::spawn` directly.
///
/// There is no way to cancel work once it has been picked up by one of the worker threads in the
/// `BlockingPool`. Dropping or shutting down the pool will block up to a timeout (default 10
/// seconds) to wait for any active blocking work to finish. Any threads running tasks that have not
/// completed by that time will be detached.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Spawn a task to run in the `BlockingPool` and await on its result.
///
/// ```edition2018
/// use cros_async::BlockingPool;
///
/// # async fn do_it() {
///     let pool = BlockingPool::default();
///
///     let res = pool.spawn(move || {
///         // Do some CPU-intensive or blocking work here.
///
///         42
