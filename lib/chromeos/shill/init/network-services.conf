# https://crbug.com/783125: "started boot-services" is relatively early in the
# boot process. This is necessary for getting online quickly, a metric which we
# optimize for alongside "time to login screen." Both automated tests (which
# want to, for example, SSH as quickly as possible after reboot) and users (who
# otherwise may wait several more seconds before network selection/connection
# UI shows up) have noticed regressions in this area in the past.
