# This file contains the Doxygen 1.8 configuration used as a starting point for
# generating the images in the images/ subdirectory. From the top-level shill
# directory, running `doxygen doc/Doxyfile` will create html/ and latex/
# directories; the html/ directory will contain .png images that can be used as
# a starting point for documentation diagrams.


# If the HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will show members with
# their full class and namespace scopes in the documentation. If set to YES, the
# scope will be hidden.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES       = YES

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns to exclude
# certain files from those directories.
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories for example use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       = *_test.cc mock_*

# The DOT_FONTSIZE tag can be used to set the size (in points) of the font of
# dot graphs.
# Minimum value: 4, maximum value: 24, default value: 10.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_FONTSIZE           = 12

# Set the DOT_TRANSPARENT tag to YES to generate images with a transparent
# background. This is disabled by default, because dot on Windows does not seem
# to support this out of the box.
#
# Warning: Depending on the platform used, enabling this option may lead to
# badly anti-aliased labels on the edges of a graph (i.e. they become hard to
# read).
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_TRANSPARENT        = YES

# If the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to YES, doxygen will remove the intermediate dot
# files that are used to generate the various graphs.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_CLEANUP            = NO
