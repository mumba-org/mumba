/*
** Figure out what version of the code to use.  The choices are
**
**   SQLITE_MUTEX_OMIT         No mutex logic.  Not even stubs.  The
**                             mutexes implementation cannot be overridden
**                             at start-time.
**
**   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP         For single-threaded applications.  No
**                             mutual exclusion is provided.  But this
**                             implementation can be overridden at
**                             start-time.
**
**   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREADS     For multi-threaded applications on Unix.
**
**   SQLITE_MUTEX_W32          For multi-threaded applications on Win32.
