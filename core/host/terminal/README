A ipc terminal api where the clients/applications can 
talk to host to serve them a terminal api

the TerminalHost is supposed to be running on the application side,
which in our case is who act as the host api handler

except if we proxify, as in:
 client(application process A) -> (TerminalHost proxy)(host process) -> (real TerminalHost) application process B

NOTE: giving we have a VM now, despite the fact that the terminal UI will be web-based using GL etc.. 
      we might use the VM to be the engine behind the terminal if this is a linux host

      the UI and the terminal IPC will be shared, but the implementation might change accordingly
      (is something we nee to think about)
