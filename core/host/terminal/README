A ipc terminal api where the clients/applications can 
talk to host to serve them a terminal api

the TerminalHost is supposed to be running on the application side,
which in our case is who act as the host api handler

except if we proxify, as in:
 client(application process A) -> (TerminalHost proxy)(host process) -> (real TerminalHost) application process B
