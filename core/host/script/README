Script is a python script infrastructure that is not actually hosted on the host process
but its executed the 'world' application/domain

While world is the default, other applications (through its domain process) might
become a ScriptHost, we just need a namespace naming system to route those properly

We use the ScriptDispatcher IPC interface that is available to every application
to communicate Host <-> World script commands


ScriptHost => World
ScriptDispatcher => Host
ScriptClient => Applications

a)

 ScriptClient(app) <=> ScriptDispatcher(host) <=> ScriptHost(world)

b)
 command line <=> ScriptDispatcher(host) <=> ScriptHost(world)
